        <h3>History of KSU Christian Union</h3>
        <p>Christian Union was started in 1995 by Madaam Grace Tombe, After the need of the school to help
students grow spiritually.<br/> The members were about 30 at that at the time since students being
recruited to the campus were also less.With time the number has grown to about 500, students and we continue 
expecting more of the students.<br/>Our CU patron is Madaam Rhodah and the deputy Cu patron is Mr.Cephar 
Omondi.
        </p>
        <p>Our vision is 'to teach' train and equip the body of christ with the word of faith.</p>
        <p>         Our programmes include:<br/>Bible Study<br/></p>
